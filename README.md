# Chess MCTS Algorithm Optimization Project

## Overview
This project explores modifications to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to enhance its performance during the opening phase of chess games. By integrating opening databases and adjusting the exploration constant, we aimed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of MCTS.

## Project Details
- Led a research project to investigate modifications to the MCTS algorithm.
- Tested the impact of integrating opening databases and adjusting the exploration constant on the performance of standard MCTS versus modified MCTS algorithms.
- Developed variants of MCTS:
  - **DM-MCTS**: Incorporating opening databases.
  - **IEC-MCTS**: Increasing exploration.
- Conducted 100 chess matches to compare the performance of these variants against standard MCTS.

## Results
- **DM-MCTS** achieved a remarkable 56% win rate over standard MCTS, highlighting the significant benefits of utilizing opening databases.
- However, adjusting the exploration constant in **IEC-MCTS** had a marginal impact, with only a 15% win rate improvement over standard MCTS.
- The research validates the potential of modifications like opening databases to enhance the capabilities of MCTS in chess.
